\title{PCA-GCA method for selecting the number of common and distinctive components.}
\usage{
pca_gca(DATA, Jk, cor_min, return_scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{DATA}{A concatinated data matrix with the same number of rows.}

\item{Jk}{A vector containing number of variables  in the concatinated data matrix. Please see the example below.}

\item{cor_min}{The minimum corelation bewtween two components. The default value is .9; thus, it means that if the correlation
between the two component is at least .7, then these two components are regarded as forming a single common component.}

\item{return_scores}{If TRUE, then the function will return the component scores for each block for further analysis.}
}
\value{
It prints out the number of components of each block and the number of common components. It also returns the component scores for each block for further analysis, if \code{return_scores = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Use PCA-GCA method to identify the number of common and distictive components.
}
\note{
Please be ware of the interactive input: The function first performs PCA on each data block and then displays the eigenvalues (and a scree plot).
Afterwards the function awaits the input from the user - it needs to know how many components need to be retained for that block.

\examples{
\dontrun{
DATA1 <- matrix(rnorm(50), nrow=5)
DATA2 <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow=5) #thus, we assume that DATA1 and 
                                    #DATA2 are with respect to the 
                                    #same 5 subjects here.
DATA <- cbind(DATA1, DATA2)
R <- 5
Jk <- c(10, 20) #DATA1 has 10 columns, DATA2 20.
pca_gca(DATA, Jk, cor_min = .8)
